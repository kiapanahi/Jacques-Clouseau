# ADR 002: Use of Kafka Schema Registry

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The system needs to ensure consistent schema usage across all messages to prevent schema drift, which can lead to data corruption or loss.

## Decision

We decided to integrate Kafka Schema Registry for the following reasons:

- It centralizes schema management and provides a RESTful interface for storing and retrieving Avro schemas.
- It supports schema evolution and versioning, ensuring backward and forward compatibility.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Manual Schema Management:** Involves embedding schemas within application code, which increases maintenance overhead and risk of errors.

## Consequences

- Simplifies development by separating schema management from application logic.
- Adds dependency on an external service, requiring proper monitoring and management.
