# Backend Service Architecture

## Introduction

This document details the architecture of the backend service for our big-data solution designed to track customer behavior. The backend service acts as a critical intermediary between front-end applications and our data processing pipelines, utilizing .NET and ASP.NET Core.

## Component Description

### Front-End Interaction

- **Data Ingestion:** Receives data from various front-end applications (web and mobile). This includes user actions, page views, and other interactive events.
- **Validation:** Ensures that all incoming data adheres to the expected format and schema before forwarding it to Kafka.

### Kafka Integration

- **Event Streaming:** Utilizes Apache Kafka to handle the high-throughput streaming of event data to various parts of the system.
- **Producer API:** Implements Kafka's Producer API to send validated event data into Kafka topics.

### Redis for Session Management

- **Session Storage:** Uses Redis to store and manage session data. This includes generating new session IDs and tracking active sessions.
- **Expiration:** Configures Redis to automatically expire session keys after a predefined timeout period, reducing the overhead of manual session cleanup.

### Schema Management with Kafka Schema Registry

- **Schema Validation:** Integrates with Kafka Schema Registry to validate event schemas dynamically, ensuring data integrity across services.
- **Schema Evolution:** Supports changes and evolution of event schemas without disrupting the existing data flow.

### Persistence Layer

- **Database Interactions:** Optionally interacts with a relational or NoSQL database for tasks that require persistence beyond real-time analytics, such as storing user profiles or historical data analysis.

## Key Technologies

- **Languages and Frameworks:** .NET 8.0 and ASP.NET Core for building robust, scalable backend services.
- **Message Brokers:** Apache Kafka for handling large-scale message processing.
- **In-Memory Data Stores:** Redis for fast and efficient session management.
- **Databases:** SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases for storing persistent data.

## Observability

- **Tracing:** Utilize OpenTelemetry .NET SDK to implement tracing across the system. This helps in understanding the flow of requests and identifying latency issues.
- **Metrics:** Implement Prometheus for monitoring metrics such as request rates, errors, and performance. Metrics are exposed using ASP.NET Coreâ€™s built-in support for Prometheus.
- **Logging:** Use Serilog for structured logging. Logs are enhanced with contextual information to improve diagnosability and are stored in a centralized log management solution like ELK Stack or Seq.
- **Health Checks:** ASP.NET Core health checks are used to monitor the health of the service and its dependencies, such as Redis and Kafka, ensuring timely alerts if any part of the system becomes unhealthy.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Scalability:** Ensuring the backend can scale to handle increases in traffic and data volume.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms to manage failures in data processing or downstream services.
- **Security:** Securing API endpoints and protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest.

## Conclusion

The backend service is designed to be robust, scalable, and flexible, capable of handling complex data flows and integrations essential for a comprehensive customer behavior tracking system. Emphasis on observability ensures that the system is transparent and maintainable, with strong capabilities for troubleshooting and optimization.
