# ADR 005: Use of OpenTelemetry for Observability

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To effectively monitor and troubleshoot the system, we needed a comprehensive observability solution that includes tracing, metrics, and logging.

## Decision

We chose OpenTelemetry for the following reasons:
- **Unified Observability:** Combines tracing, metrics, and logging under a single framework.
- **Interoperability:** Supports a wide range of exporters and backend systems (e.g., Prometheus, Jaeger).
- **Community Support:** Strong community and wide adoption in the industry.

## Alternatives Considered

- **ELK Stack:** Focuses primarily on logging and requires additional setup for metrics and tracing.
- **Prometheus/Grafana (for metrics only):** Would need additional tools for tracing and logging.

## Consequences

- Simplifies the implementation of observability across the system.
- Provides a single source of truth for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Ensures scalability and flexibility in choosing observability backends.
