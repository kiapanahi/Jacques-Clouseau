# ADR 001: Use of Kafka for Event Streaming

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a robust, scalable solution for processing high volumes of event data in real-time. The system must support high throughput and provide mechanisms for reliable data transmission.

## Decision

We chose Apache Kafka because:

- It supports high-throughput, low-latency processing of messages.
- It is highly scalable, allowing us to increase the number of producers and consumers effortlessly.
- It provides durable message storage and fault tolerance.

## Alternatives Considered

- **RabbitMQ:** While RabbitMQ is excellent for message queueing, it does not handle log storage or stream processing as effectively as Kafka.
- **AWS Kinesis:** Similar capabilities but vendor lock-in and potentially higher costs were a concern.

## Consequences

- Enhanced ability to handle real-time data streaming across distributed systems.
- Requires setup and maintenance of a Kafka cluster, which can increase complexity.
