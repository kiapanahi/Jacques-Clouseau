# ADR 007: Security and Data Protection Measures

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Given the sensitivity of customer data, it is crucial to implement robust security and data protection measures across the system.

## Decision

We decided to implement the following security measures:
- **Encryption:** Use TLS for data in transit and AES for data at rest.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement OAuth 2.0 and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with GDPR and CCPA.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Minimal Security:** Only basic encryption and authentication, which would not suffice for regulatory compliance.
- **Proprietary Solutions:** Could be expensive and less flexible.

## Consequences

- Ensures data security and protects customer privacy.
- Meets regulatory requirements and avoids legal issues.
- Adds complexity to the implementation but provides long-term benefits in terms of security.
