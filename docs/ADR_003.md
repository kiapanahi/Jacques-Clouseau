# ADR 003: Redis for Session Management

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our application requires managing large numbers of user sessions efficiently, with fast access to session data.

## Decision

Redis was chosen due to:

- Its performance as an in-memory data store.
- Built-in support for expiring keys, which can automatically manage session timeouts.

## Alternatives Considered

- **In-memory session storage in backend service:** Does not scale well and lacks persistence.
- **Database session storage:** Slower in terms of access speeds and increases load on the primary database.

## Consequences

- Fast and efficient session management.
- Requires careful configuration and monitoring to manage data persistence and failover.
