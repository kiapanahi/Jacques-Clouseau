# ADR 008: API Gateway for Routing and Load Balancing

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To manage incoming requests efficiently and provide load balancing, routing, and additional functionalities like rate limiting and security, we needed an API Gateway.

## Decision

We chose to implement an API Gateway using NGINX or API Gateway service provided by cloud providers for the following reasons:
- **Routing and Load Balancing:** Efficiently manages traffic and distributes load.
- **Security:** Provides a single entry point for security policies.
- **Scalability:** Easily scales with increasing traffic.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Direct Service Communication:** More complex to manage and lacks centralized control.
- **Custom Gateway Implementation:** Requires more development effort and maintenance.

## Consequences

- Simplifies traffic management and enhances scalability.
- Centralizes security and policy enforcement.
- Adds an additional layer that needs to be managed and maintained.
