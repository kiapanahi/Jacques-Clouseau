# ADR 006: Choice of Prometheus for Metrics Collection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a reliable and scalable solution for collecting and monitoring system metrics to ensure the health and performance of our services.

## Decision

We chose Prometheus for the following reasons:
- **Scalability:** Handles large-scale data collection efficiently.
- **Query Language:** PromQL is powerful for querying metrics data.
- **Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with OpenTelemetry and Grafana for visualization.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Graphite:** An older tool with less community support and fewer modern features.
- **Cloud-based Monitoring (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor):** More expensive and ties the solution to a specific cloud provider.

## Consequences

- Provides robust and scalable metrics collection.
- Enables powerful and flexible querying of metrics data.
- Facilitates integration with other observability tools for a comprehensive monitoring solution.
