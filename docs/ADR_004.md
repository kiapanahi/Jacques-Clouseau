# ADR 004: Choice of .NET and ASP.NET Core

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a robust, scalable, and maintainable framework for building the backend services for our big-data solution. The framework should support modern development practices and provide extensive tooling and library support.

## Decision

We chose .NET and ASP.NET Core for the following reasons:
- **Performance:** ASP.NET Core is known for high performance and efficiency.
- **Cross-Platform:** Supports deployment on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Ecosystem:** Rich library ecosystem and tooling support.
- **Community and Support:** Large community and strong support from Microsoft.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Node.js:** While performant and widely used, it lacks some of the strong typing and tooling support available in .NET.
- **Java (Spring Boot):** Also a strong candidate, but the team had more expertise with .NET.

## Consequences

- Ensures high performance and scalability.
- Benefits from Microsoft's extensive support and continuous updates.
- Leverages existing team expertise and familiarity with the .NET ecosystem.
